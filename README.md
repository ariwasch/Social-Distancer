# SocialDistance
Keeps people 6 feet away

Social distancing is now a new global requirement to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This simple but useful App uses your iPhoneâ€™s camera to alert you when someone is within your six-foot safety zone. 

Click on the App and your front camera opens as you point it at anyone nearby. If someone is within 6 feet, the box around the person turns red. If the person is more than 6 feet away (approximately 2 meters), the the box around the person turns green. 

Social Distancing is EVERYONE's challenge. Social Distancer is a simple tool to help you stay safe during these difficult times.
