This app keeps people 6 feet away

This simple but useful App uses your iPhoneâ€™s camera to alert you when someone is within your six-foot safety zone. 

Click on the App and your front camera opens as you point it at anyone nearby. If someone is within 6 feet, the box around the person turns red. If the person is more than 6 feet away (approximately 2 meters), the the box around the person turns green. 

# How to use

Hold phone horizontally while directed at people. If the box around a person is green, they are beyond 6 feet from you. If the box around a person is red, they are within 6 feet of you. 

If there is no box when the camera is pointed at a person, than the camera does not see the person clear enough.

works best when the target person is standing.
